# Intro
This is a program build in TypeScript to emulate the animation found [here](http://slicker.me/javascript/particles.htm). However, this program is written not to be as few lines as possible, rather it is written to be object oriented. 

# Running
1. Compile the typescript file if any changes have been made (`tsc main.ts`)
2. Start a web server in this directory (e.g. `python3 -m http.server`)
